INTRODUCTION


As one of the pioneers in the most wonderful 
art-science of the
age--the motion picture industry--the writer 
feels doubly qualified
perhaps to throw some light upon a subject 
equally interesting to
author and producer.

A few years ago to the uninitiated “moving 
pictures” spelt little more
than pantomime, buffoonery or sensational 
catch-penny device. To-day,
there are few who maintain this view, and 
they are the unenlightened;
for to the vast majority of those familiar 
with the art and interested
in its progress, the word has become symbolic 
of things important and
far-reaching.

Literature is literally the basic foundation 
upon which the already
gigantic edifice of picturedom has risen.

Ten or twelve years ago picture manuscripts 
were unknown--office
boys, clerks, camera operators, any one with 
an “idea” furnished the
material from which motion pictures were 
produced. Plot was unknown,
technique did not exist, and literary and 
constructive quality was
conspicuous by its absence. The art, however, 
developed rapidly. It
was found possible to do more than portray 
outdoor scenes of moving
trains and other objects, or simple 
pantomimes with exaggerated
gesture _à la Française_. Methods were 
discovered and evolved whereby
powerfully dramatic scenes could be 
reproduced, subtilty of expression
in either serious or humorous vein could be 
communicated to numberless
people--their emotions played upon, laughter 
or tears evoked at
will--in other words, the Silent Drama was 
born.

Classic and standard literature was then 
reproduced in photodrama.
Shakespeare, Dickens, Thackeray, Scott and 
Hugo became known to
millions of people whose previous 
acquaintance with their famous works
was either very slight or non-existent. It 
was at this stage, when
literature was combined with other arts 
allied in picture production,
that the real impetus was given and the 
triumphant onward march of the
world’s greatest educator and entertainer 
commenced.

To-day, millions are invested in great 
industrial plants for the
creation and manufacture of the wordless 
drama; thousands of people
rely upon it as their sole maintenance and 
profession. Millions upon
millions of men, women and children all over 
the world look upon this
form of entertainment as their principal 
recreation and, incidentally,
are being unconsciously educated to 
understand and appreciate the
higher forms of art.

Bernard Shaw says: “The great artist is he 
who goes a step beyond the
demand and, by supplying works of a higher 
beauty and a higher interest
than have yet been perceived, succeeds after 
a brief struggle in adding
this extension of sense to the heritage of 
the race.”

There is no doubt that the works of higher 
beauty and interest
accomplished by the real artists in the 
motion picture profession have
been widely productive of the “extension of 
sense” above quoted.

All this brings us to the practical purpose 
of this discussion--the
dissemination among those who write of the 
intelligence that a new and
fruitful field is open for the works of their 
pens. The short-story
writer who gets from one hundred to five 
hundred dollars for magazine
stories can get a similar amount from the 
picture manufacturers; the
authors of international fame, who make 
thousands in royalties, can
make thousands more from picture 
royalties--and in every case without
interfering with their magazine or book 
rights. In fact, the greatest
advertising a novel could receive would be a 
preliminary exhibition all
over the world in pictures.

Many of the best modern authors have already 
gone into this field and
many more will. For the day has arrived when, 
in addition to producing
well-known plays and successful books, there 
is a need for big original
features, especially written for pictorial 
presentation.

The motion picture has narrowed the field of 
the playwright, but there
is another and broader pasture awaiting both 
the play and fiction
writer when he has mastered the technique of 
the “life portrayal.”

It is the writer’s belief that a gripping, 
compelling story, hitherto
unknown and unpublished, _properly 
picturized_ and bearing the name of
one of the best known writers of modern 
fiction, would be a greater
success artistically and financially than a 
revived popular play or
“best seller.” The words “properly 
picturized” emphasized above are
significant.
